# two years at microsoft

I've made it this far.  Here's some notes from the inside.

- Microsoft is 500+ companies inside a large brand. If you've worked in large companies this will feel natural but coming from the smaller end of town it's a bit of a trip initially.

- Someone early on told me that microsoft isn't afraid to reinvent itself...constantly. this is very true!

- Yammer really makes sense when you have 100,000 employees across the globe

- I've only scratched the surface in understanding a fraction of my business unit in my sub and yet it feels like it goes on forever

- It's intimidating and exhilarating working with incredibly smart people across a large organisation

- Be humble and helpful

- It's all about "Impact"
